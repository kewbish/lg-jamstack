# Writing Content

Every blog and website needs to have some content, so let's cover how to do that.

Inside your Hugo folder, run `hugo new posts/hello-world.md`. This'll create a new folder called posts in your content directory, and put a file called hello-world.md in it.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, it's a markup language that's commonly used to write and create rich content, and it's the language that Hugo uses. It's not very complicated, but here are some main points:
- `#` is a header, or H1 if you're familiar with HTML.
- `##` is a subheader, or H2. These go all the way down to `######`, or H6.
- You write content just like you normally do. Space paragraphs out with a newline in between, and create a line break with two spaces.
- Add lists by prefixing items with `-` or `1.` `-` produces an unordered list, while `1.` creates an ordered list. (For the ordered list, prefix the next items with `2.`, `3.`, etc.)
- Add links by using the `[text](link)` syntax, and images with `![alt text](path to image)`.
- Add code by surrounding a block in three backticks \`\`\`, or inline with one \`.

More information can be found on this [great cheatsheet by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

That being said, you'll notice that when editing the file that there's some information automatically added. Don't worry about that for now - that's *frontmatter*, or metadata, in other words. It controls some fine-tuning customizations we'll investigate soon.

One example of this frontmatter is the line:
```yaml
draft: true
```
which makes it so that `hugo server` won't actually build your files. Change this to:
```yaml
draft: false
```
so `hugo server` knows to build these files.

For now, edit your hello-world.md file, and once done, try previewing your site with `hugo server`. Navigate to `localhost:1313/posts/hello-world/`, and it should appear!
