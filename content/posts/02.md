# Adding a theme

Hugo allows us to create our own themes, but that requires a knowledge of HTML and CSS and quite a bit of time. We'll go over how to tweak the theme a bit later on, but let's just use a premade one for now.

We're going to be using the [Anubis](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-anubis/) theme for our basic site today. This is a premade theme by Dmitry Kolosov - we'll be editing it and configuring it throughout the rest of this tutorial.

Inside your Hugo site folder, run `git init` to initiate a new repository, and `git submodule add https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis.git themes/anubis` to add the theme as a submodule in your themes/anubis directory. The themes directory is where Hugo reads all themes from, so don't edit that quite yet.

If you run `hugo server`, you *still* won't have any cool theming. This is because we haven't added it in our config file yet. Rename your `config.toml` file to a `config.yaml`, and delete its contents.

Copy:
```yaml
languageCode: "en-us"
baseUrl: ""
title: "Anubis"
theme: "anubis"
paginate: 10

menu:
  main:
  - identifier: archive
    name: Archive
    title: Archive
    url: /posts/
    weight: 0

params:
  dateFormat: "2006-01-02"
  style: light-without-switcher
  readMore: true 
```
into that file.

Now, when you run `hugo server`, you'll be able to finally see something!
