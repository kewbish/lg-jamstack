# Generating the Skeleton

Hugo requires a very specific structure for its generation. After installing Hugo, navigate to your desired directory and run `hugo site new ./` in your command line. You'll get something like:
```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ archetypes
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ default.md
â”œâ”€â”€ config.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
â”œâ”€â”€ static
â””â”€â”€ themes
```
as output.

While we're here, I'm also going to introduce the `hugo server` command. Run this at any time to properly preview your site at `localhost:1313` (default port is 1313, may change if you have preconfigured Hugo another way). If you run it now, you're not going to get anything especially interesting, since we don't have any content or a theme yet.
