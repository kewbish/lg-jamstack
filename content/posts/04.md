# Theme Configuration
Remember that config.yaml file that we edited in step 2? We'll be returning to that file to edit some features of the Anubis theme. Most themes have a GitHub repo that you can turn to for help with documentation and understanding what feature flags are available.

The first thing we'll tweak is the title of our site. Open your config.yaml file, and change the:
```yaml
title: "Anubis"
```
line to:
```yaml
title: "Whatever you want!"
```

Note that the quotes are important here - that's a part of YAML syntax that is required. Put whatever you want to appear in the header on the left in the title slot.

Next, let's add a dark/light theme switcher. Normally, we'd have to add quite a bit of CSS variable magic and JS for this, but Anubis comes with this built in. Navigate under `params`, and you'll find a line that reads:
```yaml
style: light-without-switcher
```
You can change this to:
```yaml
style: auto
```
for it to recognize user themes and to add a switcher.

We can also update the author copyright bit by adding:
```yaml
author: "Your name"
description: "Site description"
```
under `params`.

And lastly, let's learn how to edit and use that frontmatter from hello-world.md. Open that file, and add:
```yaml
favorite: true
```
between the two `---` lines.

When you finally preview your site with `hugo server`, you can see that there's a new title, a theme switcher, and a star next to your favourited post.
