# Installation

Let's get started with the JAMStack by building our very own static site. We'll be using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator (piece of software that turns the markdown into HTML to display), to create our site.

This guide assumes a basic knowledge of the command line and HTML. We'll be interacting with our terminal for most of this tutorial, so you may want to read up on that if unfamiliar. 

This guide also assumes you have git working on your system, and have a basic understanding of that. If not, navigate to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and follow the installation instructions there.

First, we'll have to install Hugo. Hugo is written in Go and provides binaries for most operating systems, so navigate to [https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) and follow the instructions to install.

Some quick examples:
- On macOS or Linux with Homebrew:
```sh
brew install hugo
```
- On Windows with Chocolatey:
```sh
choco install hugo -confirm
```
- On Ubuntu/Debian:
```sh
sudo apt-get install hugo
```
- On Arch:
```sh
sudo pacman -Syu hugo
```

If your OS isn't in the list above, it's likely in the [Hugo installing guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
